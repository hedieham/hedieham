## 🕹️ **Gameplay Basics**  

1. **Revealing a Cell**  
   - Click on a cell to reveal its content:  
     - **Empty Cell**: Safe with no adjacent mines.  
     - **Numbered Cell**: Indicates the number of adjacent mines.  
     - **Mine**: 💥 Game over!  

2. **Flagging Mines**  
   - Right-click on a cell to place a flag where you suspect a mine.  
   - Flags help you avoid accidentally clicking on a mine.

3. **Chaining Reveals**  
   - When you reveal an empty cell, adjacent empty cells are also automatically uncovered.  
   - This helps you quickly clear safe areas of the board.

## 🔍 **Understanding the Numbers**  

<div style="background-color: #fffde7; padding: 10px; border-left: 5px solid #fbc02d;">
Each number indicates the **count of mines** in the eight surrounding cells:  
- **1**: One mine nearby.  
- **2**: Two mines nearby.  
- **3**: Three mines nearby.  
... and so on. Use these numbers to deduce mine locations!
</div>

## 🔑 **Strategies for Success**  

1. **Start in a Corner or Edge**

2. **Use Numbers Strategically**  
   - Analyze the numbers to determine the exact locations of mines.  

3. **Flag Mines Carefully**  
   - Avoid flagging cells unless you're absolutely sure they contain a mine.

4. **Recursive Clearing**  
   - Use numbers and revealed empty spaces to clear larger areas efficiently.
